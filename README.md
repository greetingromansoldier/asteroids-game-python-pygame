# Asteroids Game in Python

Primarily, I want to thank the guys from boot.dev for this guided project. I've never encountered such quality in any form of courses or teaching. They did an incredible job. Although I was doing it for the sake of learning, I felt absolutely amazing and challenged almost every minute and step. Thanks, guys, you are amazing!

Some of code needs refactoring now and repository (of course) needs some work with image. Otherwise, game is completely playable.

## Future (possible) upgrades:

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
